# Spotify_Songs_Streams_Prediction
This project analyzes a dataset of the most streamed songs on Spotify. A linear regression model will be used to predict the number of streams based on the following factors: artist count, presence in Spotify playlists, presence in Spotify charts, danceability, valence, energy, and instrumentalness. The project aims to understand the relationship between these song characteristics and streaming success, providing insights into the factors that contribute to a song's popularity on Spotify. The findings will demonstrate the predictive capabilities of linear regression in forecasting song stream counts within the music industry.
